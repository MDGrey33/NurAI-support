# Plan: Google Chat and Jira Integration

## 1. Define Integration Interfaces
- Create abstract base classes/interfaces:
  - `ChatClient` (methods: listen_for_messages, extract_issue_ids)
  - `IssueTrackerClient` (methods: get_issue_details)

## 2. Implement Google Chat Integration
- Implement `GoogleChatClient` based on `ChatClient` interface.
- Listen to messages in a configurable channel.
- Extract Jira issue IDs from messages using a configurable regex pattern.

## 3. Implement Jira Integration
- Implement `JiraClient` based on `IssueTrackerClient` interface.
- Retrieve issue details from Jira using extracted IDs.

## 4. Configuration
- Store channel name, Jira issue ID pattern, and all credentials in the config module (loaded from .env).

## 5. Extensibility
- Document how to add new chat or issue tracker integrations by implementing the respective interface.

## 6. Testing
- Write unit tests for both integrations, using mocks for external services.

This plan ensures the integration is modular, configurable, and easily extensible for other organizations or platforms.
