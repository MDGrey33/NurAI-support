# Incident Automation Solution Requirements

## Overview
This solution is designed to automate the initial categorization, assignment, and suggested resolution of new incident tickets. It leverages historical incident data and AI-driven analytics.

## Proposed Workflow

### Step 1: Historical Data Preparation
- Extract all historical incident records.
- Format, clean, and standardize these records for consistency.
- Generate embeddings for each incident using vectorization techniques.
- Store these vectorized incidents in a vector database for efficient retrieval.

### Step 2: Integration and Real-time Incident Monitoring
- Integrate the solution with channels where new incidents are posted (such as Google Chat and Jira).
- Automatically capture the Incident ID and related details as new incidents arise.

### Step 3: Incident Similarity and Analysis
- Vectorize the new incident details using the same embedding model as used for historical data.
- Query the vector database to retrieve incidents that are semantically similar within a defined proximity threshold.

### Step 4: Categorization and Team Assignment
- Analyze the retrieved similar incidents to identify convergence on:
  - Incident category.
  - Resolver team.
- Recommend a category and resolver team for the new incident if the analysis achieves a defined confidence level.

### Step 5: Resolution Suggestion
- Extract documented resolutions from the retrieved similar incidents, if available.
- Pass the relevant incidents and resolutions to a language model (LLM).
- Generate recommended possible resolutions based on historical patterns.

## Benefits
- Streamlines initial incident categorization and assignment.
- Reduces manual effort and accelerates the incident resolution process.
- Leverages historical data to improve operational efficiency.

---

## Technical Components
- Historical incident dataset
- Vector embedding model
- Vector database
- Real-time integration with incident-reporting channels (Google Chat, Jira)
- Language Model (LLM) for summarization and resolution suggestion

## Additional Context
- The solution can be integrated with knowledge management and knowledge gap recovery.
- Code review automation reports can be generated and added to a knowledge source for more context.
