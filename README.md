## Incident Automation Solution

This project includes an automated solution for initial incident categorization, assignment, and resolution suggestion. The system leverages historical incident data and AI-driven analytics to streamline the triage process and accelerate incident resolution.

Key features include:
- Extraction and vectorization of historical incident records
- Real-time integration with incident reporting channels (e.g., Google Chat, Jira)
- Semantic similarity analysis to recommend categories, resolver teams, and possible resolutions
- Use of a language model (LLM) to generate resolution suggestions based on historical patterns

For a detailed workflow and technical requirements, see [./docs/incident_automation_requirements.md](./docs/incident_automation_requirements.md).
